Iâ€™m a web developer with focus on Ruby on Rails, also with a good understanding of Object Oriented programming, Design Patterns and Agile methodologies. Totally comfortable working with Test Driven development, for instance, Rspec, FactoryGirl and Capybara.

With a BS degree in Computer Science, I know for certain the life cycle of a software development project. I also have experience in learning and excelling at new technologies as needed.

I am looking forward to an opportunity, which I cannot only contribute with my Ruby on Rails skills but also that will improve my abilities to work with the team.

I have experience with front-end development, including HTML, CSS and Javascript. I have worked with C# and .NET Framework for almost 5 years in the past. I have also developed a few personal projects for mobile using Android platform
