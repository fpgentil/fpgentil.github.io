<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<br/>
<p>
  I'm a Ruby developer living in Araraquara, SÃ£o Paulo - Brazil.
</p>
<p>
  Currently I'm working as a consultant developer focused on back-end features at Walmart.com.
</p>
<p>
  The stack is basically Nginx, Unicorn and then Ruby with Sinatra and Rails (there are several applications, it's not entirely micro-services oriented though), we also use Docker, Chef and Jenkins.
</p>
<p>
  Whenever I can (and have free time), I do some OS projects and tweet about random things!
