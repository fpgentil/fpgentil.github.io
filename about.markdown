I'm a Ruby developer living in [Araraquara, SÃ£o Paulo - Brazil][aqa]. Currently I'm working as a consultant developer focused on back-end features at [Walmart][walmart], I also work as a freelancer developer for a great startup based in the south of the country called [Kiskadi][kiskadi].

I started working with ruby when I was still in college back in 2010, while I was working as a .NET developer I started working on my own projects using ruby, that never stopped!
In Aug '12 I met the CEO of Kiskadi and he invited me to start working for them, one year later in Sep '13 I joined the team at Walmart.

I often tweet [here][twitter] and you can see my open source work [here][github].
